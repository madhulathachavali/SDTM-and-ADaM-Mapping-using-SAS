# SDTM-and-ADaM-Mapping-using-SAS

The aim is to conduct SDTM and ADaM mapping for the "HIV Rapid Testing and Counseling in Drug Abuse Treatment Programs in the U.S." study (NIDA CTN Protocol 0032, December 12, 2008 Version 8.0). Demographics, adverse effects, disposition/study completion, and laboratory test results domains from the study are being mapped with the aid of implementation guides, study protocol, and annotated CRF. The resulting mapped data will then be used to develop code for producing tables, listings, and graphs.
